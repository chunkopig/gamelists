Also added floating numbers when you complete business opportunities (you can turn it off in the menu) and some new early and end game items for clicking to make it still a useful thing besides just when using an autoclicker.' },

I combined the Business, Store, and Upgrades tabs into one since this is where the heart of the game is.  I also merged About and Menu into one.  I made several changes that were also requested like a reset button and a way to hide upgrades you already purchased.  I also did my best to make the toast messages more readable.  I probably did some other stuff that I am forgetting, but nonetheless, please keep the ideas coming and a huge THANK YOU to everyone testing the game and giving me feedback!' },
