# OregonTrail1978
'Oregon Trail' as Printed in the May/June 1978 Issue of Creative Computing Magazine

The source code was modified in a few areas by myself (Christopher Pedersen) in 2018
in order to make the program compatible with the version of BASIC which I'm currently
running on my own personal computer-- Chipmunk BASIC (http://www.nicholson.com/rhn/basic/).

You can find a copy of the May/June 1978 Edition of Creative Computing Magazine

Also, you will probably want to tweak the difficulty level for hunting as is described
in the source code comments by the original authors back in 1978. And if you want to 
get the full experience of playing this game on your modern day computer, make sure
to download a retro-themed terminal emulator like Cool-Retro-Term (free) or Cathode ($5).
Unfortunately, CAPS-LOCK doesn't appear to work when using Cool-Retro-Term, so I suggest
paying the $5 for Cathode. If you want to use Cool-Retro-Term, you'll want to go in
and edit the source code so that you can enter in lowercase words without affecting
the gameplay. And the third option is to simply use the free iTerm2 terminal and
go to 'View' and 'Make Text Bigger' which will also give you an old school computing feel.
